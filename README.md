# Discord-Bot

## Features
* The server has a voice channel for each hour of the day (from 12 am to 11 pm). These voice channels are all sorted under the TIME category. Will automatically move users to the correct voice channel depending on what time of the day it is. 
  * (Ex: at 4:32 pm, all users that are in voice communications for discord will reside in the *4 pm* voice channel. At 5:00 pm, all users in the *4 pm* voice channel are moved by the bot to the *5 pm* voice channel)
